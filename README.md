# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
    Different people have different needs in order to comfortably use the web, whether thats bigger text, screen readers, different sized devices, etc. As programers it's our job to ensure their ability to use our websites by keeping accessibility in our minds as we code.
2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 
    One thing a programmer can do to make their website accessible is to use as many semantic elements as possible in order to communicate the order/meaning of our code to the browser/screen reader. Another thing is to always fill in the alt attribute for images. Lastly, using responsive design for various display sizes and scalable units for the ability to change font sizes.
3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
    Variables are used for many things such as storing data. They are similar to variables in math in terms of standing in the place of a number. In algebra x can be used in the place of a number or an equation. So x could equal 5 or 5 * y etc. The difference is, some variables in JavaScript can have their contents changed. The variable myVar could equal 5, but then later we can say var myVar = 6, and now it will equal 6. Theres different kinds of variables such as var, let and const which all work a bit differently. 
4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?
    Functions are an efficient way to repeat code by creating a mini program within your code. This way, if a certain process needs to be done multiple times, the function can just be called instead of writing all the code for the process again.
5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?
    To access a key you could write array[index].key or array[index]['key']
You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
